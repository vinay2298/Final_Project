# Final_Project
CDAC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This Contains all the Files of my work
I have done the Project Using SPRING MVC Hibernate in The BackEnd 
I have used CSS and JSP for the Front End .
This Project helps in Solving the Problem of CDAC ACTS for the Interaction between Students and Faculty .
The faculty can upload the files in the Application .
Students should no more worry about the Notes downloading as they could straight forward check the files in the application and download them 
This is useful for the all the Students across all the branches in CDAC 
The Future Scope of Project is to add the Canteen Module where faculty and Students can order food through online which saves the time for all of them
standing in the line for 15-20 mins . 
For Now the Project is Running and the First Objective is Completed Successfully . 
Thank You .. Vinay :)

# Final_Project
Course MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
This Contains all the Files of my work.
I have done the Project Using SPRING MVC Hibernate in The BackEnd .
I have used CSS and JSP for the Front End .
This Project helps in Solving the Problem of CDAC ACTS for the Interaction between Students and Faculty .
The faculty can upload the files in the Application .
Students should no more worry about the Notes downloading as they could straight forward check the files in the application and download them .
This is useful for the all the Students across all the branches in CDAC .
The Future Scope of Project is to add the Canteen Module where faculty and Students can order food through online which saves the time for all of them .
standing in the line for 15-20 mins . 
For Now the Project is Running and the First Objective is Completed Successfully . 
Thank You .. Vinay :)
